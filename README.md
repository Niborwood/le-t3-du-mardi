# Le top 3 du mardi

A quick farewell app for some friends and collegues.
Built with [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/).

## What is this about?

This is a simple app that allows you to answer your top 3 of anything and compare the answers with everyone else. It's a quick and easy way to share your opinion on a topic.

Every day, a new topic is chosen and you can answer it. The next day, the topic is replaced by a new one and the previous one is archived. You can still see the previous topics and their answers.

## You said "every day"? Doesn't "mardi" mean "Tuesday"?

Yes, it does. This used to be our weekly game (every Tuesday, as you figured) but it was kind of funny so we decided to keep it going every day.

## How can I play?

Simply go to [https://top3.t3.gg](https://top3.t3.gg) and create an account using your favorite third-party authentication provider. Feel free to answer the daily topic and share your top 3 with your friends.

You can also create your own and share it with others. Vote for other people topics, so they can be chosen as the daily topic! They even might vote for yours ;)

## Can I play this in English?

No, you can't. This app is only available in French. Sorry about that.
